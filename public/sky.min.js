        Yates is (literally) your second hand man; a 50/50 medley of robotic and organic components, cobbled into a hodge-podge of an android. 
        The bio stuff is cut-rate, to say the least, likely because he sustains every six hours or so with junk food and their abundant hydrocarbons.
        Thus, he constantly smells vaguely of processed cheese dust.
    
        Presently, he's trying to salvage what's left of your engine, landing gear, and
        emergency seagull repellent.

    Your command chair is surrounded by an array of screens, lights and controls telling you every detail
    of what's happening on your ship. Right now, they're all very upset for some reason. A distant alarm
    echoes from the engine cavity. A sturdy metal ladder descends to the main deck.

    This part of the ship is the least damagedâ€”it's a pretty good thing you were here during the crash. The hyper-sleep pod is depowered,
    along with most everything else on this deck. Yates will probably have all the systems on and off about a hundred times before
    we can limp to a repair shop.

    Your ship lies in a crumpled heap at the top of a hill. Yates is kneeled next to an open panel, attempting repairs. A winding

    There's a sound. It's not good. Your brain, still steeped in hyper-sleep chemicals, has come round to the point
    where you're awake and something has gone woefully awry.

    It's an alarm. An alarm is ringing from the engine.

    The hyper-sleep containment unit swings open and your feet find the cold metal floor. The air of your ship is 
    thick with smoke.

    You make out some text in screamy caps on a command display:

    <div class='console'>
    ALL SYSTEMS FAILED
    </div>

    <div class='console'>
    COLLISION WITH PLANET SNORLAG IMMINENT
    </div>

    WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!!

    Then another sound: this one is sudden and shakes the entire ship. You grasp a bulkhead and nearly slice your fingers on
    the cheap titanium bolts holding your ship together. Another shake, like being inside a dump truck that's currently
    in the process of traversing to Mars by catapult.

    After that, everything is still. The alarm is still ringing. Your engineer, and the only member of your crew, Yates,
    emerges into your still blurry vision.

    "Sorry, boss," said Yates with a noisy slurp. He was drinking something. Slowly it dawned on you; it was a ginormous can of raspberry soda pop,
    festooned with a cherry-red flamingo straw.

    "Not sure how it happened, but somebody got raspberry soda all over the engine core. Had to make an emergency landing till
    we can fix this rig. Shouldn't be more than a couple of weeks.
